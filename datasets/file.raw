The Sugar Loaf is a cool experience with the cable car etc , but it is a lot smaller , you do not get the 360 view and if you only have time to do one , do the Christ !

The experience itself was worth doing , but there were 2 drawbacks - ( 1 ) the crowds precluded getting an up-close-and-personal view of Rio as they were 25 deep , and ( 2 ) it was somewhat disconcerting ( if not sacrilegeous ) seeing dozens of people mimicking the figure of Christ while lying on the ground , having their picture taken in front of the statue .

I was lucky and did not have bad experience of getting to the statue as other had , But if you want to take photo of the statue and its surroundings then it would be very disappointing , Forget about the picture you always see from postcards or other ads , ( ie the statue on top of the hills and city ) as you would not able to get even one that would be close to it , Just too many people and not worth the trip for me , especially if you have to waste hours for queuing , !
