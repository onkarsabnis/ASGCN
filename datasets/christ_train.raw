The experience itself was worth doing , but there were 2 drawbacks - ( 1 ) the crowds precluded getting an up-close-and-personal view of Rio as they were 25 deep , and ( 2 ) it was somewhat disconcerting ( if not sacrilegeous ) seeing dozens of people mimicking the figure of Christ while lying on the ground , having their picture taken in front of the statue .
